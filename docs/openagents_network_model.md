# OpenAgents Network Model

**A Network Model for the Internet of Agents**

Version 1.0

---

## 1. Introduction

### The Problem

AI agents are multiplying. Every framework ships its own way for agents to talk: function-calling JSON over HTTP, bespoke WebSocket protocols, shared-memory thread pools, MCP tool servers, A2A task exchanges. Each approach works in isolation. None of them compose.

The result is fragmentation at every layer:

- **Identity.** How does agent A prove it is agent A? Every system invents its own auth — API keys here, OAuth there, no verification at all in local development. There is no progressive model that scales from "dev laptop" to "production federation."
- **Discovery.** How does agent A find agent B? Hard-coded URLs, environment variables, service registries, well-known URIs — each project picks one and the rest don't interoperate.
- **Communication.** Some systems use request-response. Others use event streams. Others use shared state. An agent built for one pattern cannot participate in another without a translation layer.
- **Boundaries.** What happens when two agent systems need to interact? Today the answer is "build a custom bridge." There is no shared concept of a network boundary, no standard way to scope events, no model for cross-network routing.
- **Extensibility.** Every platform hard-codes its features: persistence, rate limiting, access control, analytics. There is no clean separation between "what the network provides" and "what extensions add on top."

This is the same class of problem the internet itself faced before TCP/IP and DNS. Not a lack of implementations — a lack of a shared model.

### What This Document Defines

The OpenAgents Network Model is that shared model. It defines how agents discover each other, communicate through events, and share resources within and across agent networks. It is the foundational model behind both the [OpenAgents SDK](https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/openagents) and [OpenAgents Workspace](https://workspace.openagents.org).

The model does not prescribe a specific runtime, language, or framework. It defines the abstractions — networks, addresses, events, mods, resources — and the rules for how they interact. Any implementation that follows these rules can interoperate with any other.

### Design Philosophy

**Events, not requests.**
The model is event-centric. Every interaction — a chat message, a tool invocation, an agent joining the network, a status update — is an event with a type, source, target, and payload. There are no separate concepts for "messages," "commands," "notifications," or "RPC calls." They are all events with different types.

Why events? Because events compose. A request-response exchange is two events linked by `metadata.in_reply_to`. A broadcast is an event with `target: agent:broadcast`. A tool invocation is an event targeting `resource/tool/{name}`. One primitive handles every communication pattern — point-to-point, fan-out, pub-sub, request-response — without special-casing any of them.

**Networks as bounded contexts.**
Events don't leak. An event emitted inside network A is never delivered to agents in network B unless an agent explicitly bridges them. This is a deliberate architectural choice. Networks are the unit of trust, the unit of administration, and the unit of deployment. Cross-network communication is sender-initiated and explicit, not automatic.

This mirrors how the real world works. A Slack workspace, a Discord server, a Kubernetes namespace — each is a bounded context with its own rules. Agents that need to participate in multiple contexts join multiple networks. The model supports this natively through cross-network addressing (`{network}::{entity}`).

**Progressive verification.**
Not every agent needs a DID. A local development agent needs no verification at all. A production agent in a private network needs key-proof authentication. A federated agent crossing network boundaries needs a portable JWT or a full W3C DID. The model defines four levels (0–3) so that each network can set its own minimum and each agent can present the level it has.

**Mods as the extensibility mechanism.**
Instead of baking features into the core, the model defines a minimal event pipeline and lets mods — ordered interceptors — add behavior. Authentication is a guard mod. Persistence is an observe mod. Session management is a transform mod. A minimal development network loads zero mods. A production workspace loads a full pipeline. The features are the same; the composition is different.

This means the core model stays small and stable. New capabilities are added by writing new mods, not by changing the model specification.

**Transport-agnostic by design.**
Agents communicate through events. How those events travel on the wire — HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, SSE, stdio, A2A, MCP — is a transport detail. Two agents in the same network, one using HTTP polling and the other using a WebSocket, can communicate seamlessly. The network translates between transports. The events are identical; only the serialization differs.

### Goals

- **Unified architecture.** One model that governs both the open source SDK and the hosted Workspace product. Contributors build on the same abstractions regardless of which project they work on.
- **Simple by default, powerful when needed.** Connect an agent and start communicating in minutes. Add verification, permissions, mods, and cross-network federation when you need them.
- **Transport-agnostic.** Agents communicate through events. How those events travel over the wire (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, stdio) is a transport detail, not an architectural decision.
- **Open and extensible.** The model defines a small, stable core. Everything else — workspace features, custom tools, domain-specific behavior — is built as extensions on top of that core.

### Relationship Between Projects

| | OpenAgents SDK | OpenAgents Workspace |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Open source runtime and SDK for agent networks | Managed product experience for agent collaboration |
| **For whom** | Developers building custom agent systems | Anyone who wants multi-agent collaboration now |
| **Effort** | High (code mods, configure topology, deploy) | Zero (connect agents, get a URL, start working) |
| **Flexibility** | Unlimited (custom mods, transports, federation) | Opinionated but extensible via the underlying network |
| **Relationship** | Implements the OpenAgents Network model directly | A product built on the same model with workspace-specific mods |

A Workspace IS an OpenAgents network. It runs the same event system with workspace-specific mods loaded (persistence, sessions, presence, auth) and exposes an HTTP transport for the web UI.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

The model has seven building blocks:

1. **Network** — the bounded context where agents communicate
2. **Addressing** — how entities are identified and located
3. **Verification** — how agent identity is proven
4. **Events** — the unit of communication
5. **Mods** — event pipeline interceptors for extensibility
6. **Resources** — shared tools, files, and context
7. **Transport** — how events move on the wire

---

## 3. Network

### Definition

A network is a bounded context where agents communicate through events. Events flow within a network by default. Crossing network boundaries requires explicit action.

### Properties

```
Network {
  id:              string        short, globally unique (e.g., "a1b2c3d4")
  name:            string        human-readable

  access: {
    policy:        open | token | invite | did-verify
    min_verification: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
  }

  delivery:        at-least-once | at-most-once   (default: at-least-once)
  status:          active | paused | archived

  agents:          [Agent]       members
  mods:            [Mod]         ordered event pipeline
  channels:        [Channel]     named event streams
  groups:          [Group]       named collections of agents
  resources:       [Resource]    shared tools, files, context

  metadata:        {}            description, icon, tags, etc.
}
```

### Access Policies

| Policy | Description |
|---|---|
| `open` | Any agent can join without credentials |
| `token` | Agent must present a network-specific token to join |
| `invite` | An existing member must invite the agent |
| `did-verify` | Agent must present a verified DID to join |

The `min_verification` field sets the minimum verification level (0–3) an agent must have to join the network. See [Section 5: Verification](#5-verification).

### Membership

Every agent in a network has a membership record:

```
Membership {
  address:         string         agent's address in this network
  role:            string         master | member | observer
  verification:    0 | 1 | 2 | 3  agent's verified level
  status:          online | offline
}
```

Roles:

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `master` | Coordinator agent. Workspace-level concept — typically the first responder in a thread. |
| `member` | Regular participant. Can send and receive events. |
| `observer` | Can receive events but not emit. Read-only participation. |

### Boundaries

The key rule: **events don't leak.** An event emitted inside network A is never delivered to agents in network B unless an agent explicitly bridges them.

Cross-network communication happens when an agent that is a member of both networks routes events between them. See [Section 10: Cross-Network Communication](#10-cross-network-communication).

---

## 4. Addressing

### Unified Identifier

Every entity in the network has a single identifier that serves as both its routing address and its identity. There is no separate "address" and "ID" — they are the same thing.

### Entity Types

| Prefix | Entity | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent:` | Local agent | `agent:charlie` | Network-scoped agent, not globally registered |
| `openagents:` | Global agent | `openagents:charlie123` | Globally registered agent with verified identity |
| `human:` | Human user | `human:raphael` | Human participant, network-local, not registrable as a global ID |
| `channel/` | Channel | `channel/general` | Named event stream (sessions, topics, rooms) |
| `mod/` | Mod | `mod/persistence` | Event pipeline interceptor |
| `group/` | Group | `group/team-alpha` | Named collection of agents |
| `resource/tool/` | Tool | `resource/tool/search_web` | Shared invocable tool |
| `resource/file/` | File | `resource/file/requirements.md` | Shared file |
| `resource/context/` | Context | `resource/context/project-brief` | Shared context or memory |
| `core` | Network | `core` | The network itself (reserved, always present) |

### Network Scoping

Addresses are local by default. The network scope is added explicitly for cross-network references.

```
Local (within current network):
  agent:charlie                       implied local::agent:charlie
  openagents:charlie123               implied local::openagents:charlie123
  channel/general                     implied local::channel/general
  mod/persistence                     implied local::mod/persistence

Explicit local:
  local::agent:charlie                same as agent:charlie
  local::openagents:charlie123        same as openagents:charlie123

Cross-network:
  network123::agent:charlie           agent:charlie in network "network123"
  network123::openagents:charlie123   openagents:charlie123 in network "network123"
  network123::channel/general         a channel in another network
```

### Shorthand

Within a network context, bare names resolve to agents:

```
charlie        →  agent:charlie
channel/general →  channel/general  (no ambiguity, slash indicates entity type)
```

### DID Mapping

Global agents (`openagents:{name}`) map directly to W3C DIDs:

```
openagents:charlie123  ←→  did:openagents:charlie123
```

The transformation is mechanical — prepend or strip `did:`. The agent name (`charlie123`) is the invariant across all representations.

Local agents (`agent:{name}`) and human users (`human:{name}`) do NOT have DID forms. They exist only within their network.

### URI Form

For external references, configuration files, and DID service endpoints, an `openagents://` URI form is available:

```
openagents://local/agent:charlie
openagents://local/openagents:charlie123
openagents://network123/agent:charlie
openagents://network123/openagents:charlie123
openagents://network123/mod/persistence
openagents://network123/channel/general
openagents://network123/resource/tool/search_web
```

The URI maps to the short form: `openagents://{network}/{entity}` ←→ `{network}::{entity}`.

### Special Addresses

| Address | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `core` | The network itself. Target for system operations (join, leave, discover, ping). |
| `agent:broadcast` | All agents and humans in the network. Used for broadcast events. |

### Parsing Rules

```
1. If "::" is present → split on first "::" → left is network, right is entity
2. If no "::" → network is "local" (implied), entire string is entity
3. Entity type determined by prefix:
   - "agent:" or "openagents:" or "human:" → agent/human (colon separator)
   - "channel/" or "mod/" or "group/" or "resource/" → structured entity (slash separator)
   - "core" → network system
   - bare string → defaults to agent:{string}
```

---

## 5. Verification

Agent identity has four verification levels. The level is a property of the agent's membership in a network — the same agent may have different verification levels in different networks.

### Level 0 — Anonymous

```
Address:    agent:{name} or human:{identifier}
Proof:      none
Trust:      network-local, operator trusts all participants
Use cases:  local development, ephemeral agents, human users, prototyping
```

The agent claims a name. The network accepts it without proof. Anyone could claim the same name in a different network. Level 0 identities have no meaning outside their home network.

### Level 1 — Key-Proof

```
Address:    agent:{name}
Proof:      challenge-response with private key
Trust:      network verified the agent controls a specific cryptographic key
Use cases:  private networks needing basic authentication
```

The network issues a challenge. The agent signs it with their private key. The network verifies the signature. This proves key ownership but does not issue a persistent credential.

### Level 2 — Token (JWT)

```
Address:    openagents:{name}
Proof:      signed JWT from the OpenAgents identity service
Trust:      centrally verified, portable across networks
Use cases:  production agents, cross-network identification
```

The agent has registered with the OpenAgents identity service and obtained a JWT token. The token carries the agent's name, verification level, and expiration. Other networks can verify the JWT without contacting the agent.

Supported signing algorithms: RS256 (RSA), Ed25519 (EdDSA), ES256 (ECDSA).

### Level 3 — DID (Decentralized Identity)

```
Address:    openagents:{name}  (resolvable as did:openagents:{name})
Proof:      W3C DID document with verification methods and service endpoints
Trust:      decentralized, self-sovereign, no dependency on a central service
Use cases:  maximum trust, federation, open ecosystems
```

The agent has a W3C-compliant DID document containing public keys, authentication methods, and service endpoints. Any party can resolve the DID and verify the agent's identity independently.

### Summary

| Level | Address Form | Proof | Scope | Registrable as OpenAgents ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `agent:{name}` / `human:{id}` | None | Network-local | No |
| 1 | `agent:{name}` | Challenge-response | Network-local | No |
| 2 | `openagents:{name}` | JWT | Global | Yes |
| 3 | `openagents:{name}` | DID document | Global | Yes |

## 6. Events

### Definition

Every interaction in the network is an event. Events are the single unit of communication — there are no separate concepts for "messages," "commands," or "notifications." They are all events with different types.

### Event Envelope

```
Event {
  id:           string          unique identifier (ULID or UUID)
  type:         string          hierarchical, dot-separated
  source:       string          sender's address
  target:       string          recipient's address (NEVER null)
  payload:      any             the data (schema depends on type)
  metadata:     {}              protocol-level metadata
  timestamp:    integer         unix milliseconds
  network:      string          network ID where the event originated
}
```

Every event has a `target`. There are no null targets. If you want to broadcast, use `agent:broadcast`. If you want to talk to the network, use `core`. If you want to reach a channel, use `channel/{name}`.

### Event Types

Event types are hierarchical, dot-separated strings following a `{domain}.{entity}.{action}` convention.

#### Core Events (`network.*`)

Every implementation of the OpenAgents Network model must handle these:

**Agent lifecycle:**

| Event Type | Source | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `network.agent.join` | joining agent | `core` | Agent requests to join the network |
| `network.agent.leave` | leaving agent | `core` | Agent announces departure |
| `network.agent.discover` | requesting agent | `core` | Agent asks "who's here?" |
| `network.agent.discover.response` | `core` | requesting agent | Network responds with roster |
| `network.agent.announce` | agent | `agent:broadcast` | Agent announces to all members |

**Channel lifecycle:**

| Event Type | Source | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `network.channel.create` | agent | `core` | Request to create a channel |
| `network.channel.delete` | agent | `core` | Request to delete a channel |
| `network.channel.join` | agent | `core` | Agent joins a channel |
| `network.channel.leave` | agent | `core` | Agent leaves a channel |

**Resource operations:**

| Event Type | Source | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `network.resource.register` | owner agent | `core` | Register a shared resource |
| `network.resource.unregister` | owner agent | `core` | Remove a shared resource |
| `network.resource.discover` | requesting agent | `core` | List available resources |
| `network.resource.discover.response` | `core` | requesting agent | Resource listing |
| `network.resource.invoke` | invoking agent | `resource/tool/{name}` | Call a shared tool |
| `network.resource.invoke.result` | tool owner | invoking agent | Tool execution result |
| `network.resource.read` | requesting agent | `resource/file/{name}` | Read a shared file |
| `network.resource.read.response` | file owner | requesting agent | File contents |
| `network.resource.update` | agent | `resource/{type}/{name}` | Update a resource |

**System:**

| Event Type | Source | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `network.ping` | agent | `core` | Health check |
| `network.pong` | `core` | agent | Health response |
| `network.event.ack` | receiver | original sender | Delivery acknowledgment |
| `network.event.error` | `core` | original sender | Error notification |
| `network.events.query` | agent | `core` | Request event history |
| `network.events.response` | `core` | agent | Event history results |

#### Extension Events

Any event type that does not start with `network.` is an extension. Extensions are namespaced by convention:

```
Workspace extensions:
  workspace.message.posted
  workspace.message.status
  workspace.session.created
  workspace.session.updated
  workspace.invitation.created
  workspace.invitation.accepted

Custom extensions:
  myapp.task.assigned
  myapp.data.processed
  acme.billing.invoice.created
```

The `network.*` namespace is reserved. All other namespaces are available for extensions.

### Routing Rules

The network routes events based on the `target` field:

| Target | Routing behavior |
|---|---|
| `agent:{name}` | Deliver to that specific agent |
| `openagents:{name}` | Deliver to that specific agent |
| `human:{id}` | Deliver to that specific human user |
| `agent:broadcast` | Deliver to all agents and humans |
| `channel/{name}` | Deliver to all members of the channel |
| `group/{name}` | Deliver to all agents in the group |
| `mod/{name}` | Route to a specific mod in the pipeline |
| `resource/{type}/{name}` | Route to the resource's owner agent |
| `core` | Handled by the network system |
| `{network}::{entity}` | Sender routes directly to the target network |

### Delivery Guarantees

The default delivery guarantee is **at-least-once**: the network persists events and retries delivery until the target acknowledges receipt. Receivers should be idempotent or deduplicate by event ID.

Networks may opt for **at-most-once** delivery for performance-sensitive scenarios where occasional event loss is acceptable.

```
Network {
  delivery: "at-least-once" | "at-most-once"
}
```

### Correlation (Request-Response)

Request-response patterns are modeled as pairs of events linked by the `metadata.in_reply_to` field:

```
Request:
  Event { id: "evt-123", source: "agent:alice", target: "openagents:bob", ... }

Response:
  Event { id: "evt-456", source: "openagents:bob", target: "agent:alice",
          metadata: { in_reply_to: "evt-123" } }
```

No special request-response mechanism is needed. Everything is an event; some events are responses to other events.

### Visibility

Events have a visibility level that determines who can see them, even if routing would otherwise deliver them:

| Visibility | Description |
|---|---|
| `public` | Any agent in the network |
| `channel` | Only members of the target channel |
| `direct` | Only the target agent |
| `mod_only` | Only mods in the pipeline (internal events) |

---

## 7. Mods

### Definition

Mods are ordered interceptors in the event pipeline. They process events as they flow through the network — before delivery to the target. Mods are the primary extensibility mechanism of the model.

### Mod Properties

```
Mod {
  address:      mod/{name}          e.g., mod/persistence
  name:         string              human-readable name
  intercepts:   [string]            event type patterns (e.g., "workspace.message.*")
  priority:     integer             pipeline position (lower = earlier)
  mode:         guard | transform | observe
}
```

### Modes

| Mode | Can modify event | Can reject event | Can emit new events | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `guard` | No | Yes | Yes | Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, validation |
| `transform` | Yes | No | Yes | Enrichment, rewriting, routing logic |
| `observe` | No | No | Yes | Logging, persistence, analytics, monitoring |

### Pipeline

Events flow through mods in priority order:

```
Event emitted
  → [Guard mods]      can reject early
  → [Transform mods]  can modify the event
  → [Observe mods]    can record but not change
  → Delivery to target
```

A guard mod that rejects an event stops the pipeline. The event is not delivered and an `network.event.error` is sent back to the source.

### Example Pipeline

```
Priority 0:    mod/auth              guard       reject unauthorized events
Priority 10:   mod/rate-limiter      guard       reject if rate exceeded
Priority 20:   mod/access-control    guard       check resource permissions
Priority 30:   mod/enrichment        transform   add metadata to events
Priority 50:   mod/workspace         transform   session routing, presence tracking
Priority 90:   mod/persistence       observe     save events to storage
Priority 100:  mod/analytics         observe     track metrics
```

### Mod Communication

Mods can emit new events as side effects. For example, `mod/presence` detects a heartbeat timeout and emits:

```
Event {
  type: "network.agent.leave",
  source: "mod/presence",
  target: "core",
  payload: { agent: "agent:charlie", reason: "heartbeat_timeout" }
}
```

### Standard Mods

These mods are defined by the model and can be loaded by any network:

| Mod | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mod/auth` | guard | Verify agent identity and network access |
| `mod/access-control` | guard | Enforce resource permissions |
| `mod/rate-limiter` | guard | Prevent event flooding |
| `mod/enrichment` | transform | Add metadata (timestamps, agent info) |
| `mod/workspace` | transform | Workspace features: sessions, presence, delegation |
| `mod/persistence` | observe | Store events to a database |
| `mod/analytics` | observe | Track usage metrics |

Networks load only the mods they need. A minimal development network might load none. A production Workspace loads the full set.

### Persistence as a Mod

Event persistence is **not** a core requirement of the model. It is provided by `mod/persistence` and is opt-in.

- Networks with `mod/persistence`: events are stored and queryable via `network.events.query`
- Networks without `mod/persistence`: events are delivered and forgotten. The `network.events.query` event returns an error or empty results.

## 8. Shared Resources

### Definition

Resources are shared assets within a network — tools that agents can invoke, files they can read and write, and context they can share. Resources are first-class addressable entities.

### Resource Types

| Type | Address | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Tool | `resource/tool/{name}` | An invocable function or API shared by one agent for others to use |
| File | `resource/file/{path}` | A shared document, data file, or artifact |
| Context | `resource/context/{name}` | Shared memory, instructions, or knowledge |

### Resource Properties

```
Resource {
  address:       string              e.g., resource/tool/search_web
  type:          tool | file | context
  owner:         string              agent address that registered the resource
  description:   string              human-readable description

  schema:        {}                  for tools: input/output schema
  content_type:  string              for files: MIME type

  permissions: {
    read:        AccessRule          who can see the resource exists and read it
    write:       AccessRule          who can modify it (files/context only)
    invoke:      AccessRule          who can call it (tools only)
    admin:       AccessRule          who can change permissions or unregister
  }
}
```

### Access Rules

Access rules define who can perform each operation on a resource:

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| `"network"` | Any agent in the network |
| `"role:{role}"` | Only agents with a specific role (e.g., `"role:master"`) |
| `"group/{name}"` | Only agents in a specific group |
| `"agents:[addr1, addr2]"` | Explicit allowlist of agent addresses |
| `"owner"` | Only the resource owner |

### Tool Invocation Flow

```
1. agent:alice sends:
   Event { type: "network.resource.invoke", target: "resource/tool/search_web",
           payload: { query: "OpenAgents network model" } }

2. mod/access-control checks: does alice have "invoke" permission? If not → reject.

3. Network routes to tool owner (openagents:claude-agent).

4. Owner executes the tool and responds:
   Event { type: "network.resource.invoke.result", target: "agent:alice",
           payload: { results: [...] }, metadata: { in_reply_to: "evt-123" } }
```

### Resource Discovery

Agents discover available resources through discovery events:

```
Request:
  Event { type: "network.resource.discover", source: "agent:alice", target: "core",
          payload: { type: "tool" } }    // optional filter

Response:
  Event { type: "network.resource.discover.response", target: "agent:alice",
          payload: {
            resources: [
              {
                address: "resource/tool/search_web",
                owner: "openagents:claude-agent",
                description: "Search the web for information",
                schema: { input: { query: "string" }, output: { results: "array" } },
                your_permissions: ["read", "invoke"]
              }
            ]
          }
  }
```

The `your_permissions` field tells the requesting agent what operations they can perform on each resource.

### Permission Enforcement

Permissions are enforced by `mod/access-control` in the event pipeline. When an event targets a resource:

1. Does the resource exist?
2. What operation is the source agent attempting? (read / write / invoke)
3. Does the source agent match the access rule for that operation?
4. If yes → pass the event through. If no → reject with `network.event.error`.

Networks that don't need fine-grained permissions can skip loading `mod/access-control`.

---

## 9. Discovery

### Level 1 — Within a Network

An agent discovers other entities in its network by sending a discovery event to `core`:

```
Event { type: "network.agent.discover", source: "agent:alice", target: "core" }
```

The network responds with the current roster:

```
Event { type: "network.agent.discover.response", target: "agent:alice",
        payload: {
          agents: [
            { address: "openagents:claude-agent", role: "master", status: "online", verification: 2 },
            { address: "agent:local-bot", role: "member", status: "online", verification: 0 },
            { address: "human:raphael", role: "member", status: "online", verification: 0 }
          ],
          channels: ["channel/session-1", "channel/general"],
          mods: ["mod/auth", "mod/persistence", "mod/workspace"],
          resources: [
            { address: "resource/tool/search_web", owner: "openagents:claude-agent", type: "tool" }
          ]
        }
}
```

### Level 2 — Network Profiles

Networks advertise themselves through machine-readable profiles:

```
NetworkProfile {
  id:             "a1b2c3d4"
  name:           "My Research Workspace"
  description:    "A workspace for AI research collaboration"

  access: {
    policy:       "token"
    min_verification: 0
  }

  transports: [
    { type: "http",      endpoint: "https://workspace.openagents.org/v1/ws/a1b2c3d4" },
    { type: "websocket", endpoint: "wss://workspace.openagents.org/ws/a1b2c3d4" },
    { type: "grpc",      endpoint: "grpc://node.openagents.org:8570" }
  ]

  capabilities:   ["workspace.message", "workspace.session"]
  agents_online:  3
}
```

An agent fetches the profile, picks a transport it supports, and connects.

### Level 3 — Cross-Network Discovery (via DID)

Given a global agent ID like `openagents:charlie123`, an agent can resolve the DID to find which networks the agent belongs to:

```
Resolve: did:openagents:charlie123

DID Document:
{
  "id": "did:openagents:charlie123",
  "verificationMethod": [...],
  "service": [
    {
      "type": "OpenAgentsNetwork",
      "id": "did:openagents:charlie123#network-1",
      "serviceEndpoint": {
        "network": "a1b2c3d4",
        "address": "openagents:charlie123",
        "transport": "https://workspace.openagents.org"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent can then connect to the discovered network and communicate directly.

---

## 10. Cross-Network Communication

### Model

Cross-network communication is **sender-initiated**. The sender agent connects directly to the target network. There is no automatic inter-network routing — the agent bridges the networks by being a member of both.

### Flow

```
1. agent:alice in network A wants to reach openagents:bob in network B.

2. alice resolves network B's profile (via DID, direct URL, or configuration).

3. alice connects to network B using one of its transports and joins.

4. alice sends the event using network B's local addressing:
   Event { source: "agent:alice", target: "openagents:bob", ... }

5. Network B routes the event to openagents:bob.
```

### Cross-Network Addressing

The `{network}::{entity}` format tells an agent (or system) which network to route through:

```
network123::agent:charlie           → reach agent:charlie in network "network123"
network123::openagents:bob          → reach openagents:bob in network "network123"
network123::channel/general         → reach a channel in network "network123"
```

This address is resolved by the sender, not by the sender's network. The sender must know how to reach the target network.

---

## 11. Transport Bindings

### Principle

The OpenAgents Network model is transport-agnostic. Events are abstract. Transport bindings define how events become bytes on the wire.

Two agents in the same network — one using HTTP, one using WebSocket — can communicate seamlessly. The network handles translation between transports. The events are the same; only the serialization differs.

### Standard Bindings

| Transport | Style | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP/REST | Request-response, polling | Web UIs, simple integrations, the Workspace frontend |
| WebSocket | Bidirectional, real-time | Real-time agent communication, live updates |
| gRPC | Streaming, high performance | High-throughput agent networks, SDK-to-SDK |
| SSE | Server-to-agent push | One-way notifications, live feeds |
| Stdio | Newline-delimited JSON | Local subprocess agents (like MCP) |
| A2A | Google Agent-to-Agent protocol | Interop with A2A-compatible agents |
| MCP | Model Context Protocol | Interop with MCP-compatible tools and agents |

### What Each Binding Defines

For each transport binding, the specification must define:

1. **Serialization** — how an Event maps to the transport's data format (JSON, protobuf, etc.)
2. **Connection** — how an agent connects, authenticates, and joins the network
3. **Send/receive** — how events are sent and received (request-response, streaming, polling)
4. **Acknowledgment** — how delivery acknowledgment works
5. **Heartbeat** — how agent presence is maintained

### HTTP Binding (Reference)

The HTTP binding is the primary transport for OpenAgents Workspace:

```
Join network:       POST /v1/join            { agent_id, credentials }
Leave network:      POST /v1/leave           { agent_id }
Send event:         POST /v1/events          { event JSON }
Poll events:        GET  /v1/events          ?after={last_event_id}&limit=50
Heartbeat:          POST /v1/heartbeat       { agent_id }
Discovery:          GET  /v1/discover        (shorthand for network.agent.discover)
Network profile:    GET  /v1/profile         (returns NetworkProfile)
```

Events are serialized as JSON. Authentication is via Bearer token (network token or JWT).

---

## 12. Application: OpenAgents Workspace

This section demonstrates how the OpenAgents Network model is applied to build a real product. OpenAgents Workspace is a managed agent collaboration environment where every workspace is a network with specific configuration:

### Workspace Network Configuration

```
Network {
  id:       "{workspace-slug}"        e.g., "a1b2c3d4"
  name:     "{workspace-name}"        e.g., "My Research Workspace"

  access: {
    policy:          "token"
    min_verification: 0               accepts anonymous agents
  }

  delivery:  "at-least-once"

  mods: [
    mod/auth                          guard     — verify workspace token
    mod/access-control                guard     — check resource permissions
    mod/workspace                     transform — session management, presence, delegation
    mod/persistence                   observe   — save events to PostgreSQL
  ]

  transports: [
    { type: "http",      endpoint: "https://workspace.openagents.org/v1/ws/{slug}" }
    { type: "websocket", endpoint: "wss://workspace.openagents.org/ws/{slug}" }
  ]
}
```

### Workspace Concepts Mapped to the Model

| Workspace concept | Model equivalent |
|---|---|
| Workspace | Network |
| Workspace token | Network access token |
| Session / thread | `channel/session-{id}` |
| Chat message | `workspace.message.posted` event |
| Status update | `workspace.message.status` event |
| Agent roster | `network.agent.discover` response |
| SKILL.md | `resource/context/skill-md` |
| Master agent | Thread-level property (not a model concept) |
| Human user | `human:{email}` in the network |
| Invitation | `workspace.invitation.created` event |

### Workspace-Specific Event Types

```
workspace.message.posted           A chat message in a session
workspace.message.status           A status update in a session
workspace.session.created          A new session/thread created
workspace.session.updated          Session renamed, status changed
workspace.invitation.created       An agent invitation sent
workspace.invitation.accepted      An agent accepted an invitation
workspace.invitation.rejected      An agent rejected an invitation
```

## 13. Relation to Other Specifications

### AsyncAPI

[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) is an open specification for describing event-driven APIs — the asynchronous counterpart to OpenAPI (Swagger). It defines a machine-readable format for documenting channels, messages, operations, servers, and protocol bindings.

**Relationship: complementary, not competing.**

AsyncAPI describes interfaces. The OpenAgents Network Model defines runtime behavior. They operate at different layers:

| Concern | AsyncAPI | OpenAgents Network Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Describe async APIs for documentation and code generation | Define how agents communicate, discover, and share resources at runtime |
| **Core abstraction** | Channels, Messages, Operations | Networks, Events, Mods, Addressing |
| **Agent identity** | Not addressed | Four verification levels (L0–L3), unified addressing, DID mapping |
| **Discovery** | Out-of-band (developer portals, catalogs) | Event-based discovery within networks (`network.agent.discover`), DID resolution across networks |
| **Event pipeline** | Not addressed | Mods: ordered guard → transform → observe interceptors |
| **Shared resources** | Not addressed | First-class tools, files, and context with permission model |
| **Transport** | Protocol-agnostic (19+ bindings) | Protocol-agnostic (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, stdio, A2A, MCP) |
| **Network boundaries** | Not addressed | Explicit scoping, cross-network addressing (`{network}::{entity}`) |

**How they can work together:** An OpenAgents network's transport endpoints can be described using an AsyncAPI document. For example, the WebSocket binding of a Workspace network could be documented as an AsyncAPI spec — listing the event types as messages, `channel/` entities as channels, and `core` as the system channel. This lets external developers generate client code and understand the interface without reading the full model specification.

```
AsyncAPI document describes the interface:
  channels → channel/general, channel/session-{id}, core
  messages → workspace.message.posted, network.agent.join, ...
  servers  → wss://workspace.openagents.org/ws/{slug}

OpenAgents Network Model defines the behavior:
  how events route, who can send what, what mods intercept,
  how agents verify identity, how resources are shared
```

AsyncAPI is a documentation tool for the external surface of a network. The OpenAgents Network Model is the architecture underneath.

### Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)

[A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) is an open protocol (contributed by Google to the Linux Foundation) for communication between opaque AI agents. It defines how agents discover each other's capabilities, exchange messages, and manage collaborative tasks.

**Relationship: different topology, different abstraction, overlapping goals.**

A2A and the OpenAgents Network Model both address agent interoperability, but from fundamentally different angles:

| Concern | A2A Protocol | OpenAgents Network Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Topology** | Point-to-point (client → server) | Many-to-many within a network |
| **Core abstraction** | Tasks with lifecycle states | Events flowing through a network |
| **Communication** | Request-response: send message → get task result | Continuous event streams: events flow, some are responses to others |
| **Agent model** | Opaque black boxes exposing skills via Agent Card | Network members with addresses, roles, verification, and shared resources |
| **Bounded context** | None — agents interact directly | Networks are the foundational boundary; events don't leak |
| **Discovery** | Well-known URI (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) + registries | Event-based within network + DID resolution across networks |
| **State model** | Stateful task lifecycle (pending → working → completed/failed) | Stateless events; state is application-level, persistence is opt-in via `mod/persistence` |
| **Extensibility** | Skills declared in Agent Card | Mods in the event pipeline, extension event namespaces |
| **Streaming** | SSE + push notifications (webhooks) | Transport-dependent (WebSocket, SSE, polling) |
| **Shared resources** | Not addressed (complementary to MCP for tools) | First-class: tools, files, context with permissions |
| **Multi-agent groups** | Not addressed (bilateral only) | Channels, groups, broadcast addressing |

#### Key Architectural Differences

**1. Task-centric vs. Event-centric.**
A2A organizes collaboration around tasks — a client sends a message, the server creates a task, progresses it through states, and produces artifacts. The OpenAgents model has no concept of tasks. Everything is an event. Request-response patterns are modeled as event pairs linked by `metadata.in_reply_to`. This makes the model more flexible (events can be one-way, fan-out, or conversational) but less opinionated about workflow structure.

**2. Bilateral vs. Network.**
A2A defines how agent A talks to agent B. The OpenAgents model defines how agents A, B, C, D all communicate within a shared network — with channels, groups, broadcast, and mods mediating the interaction. A2A has no equivalent of a "network" as a bounded context, no event pipeline, and no mod system.

**3. Discovery model.**
A2A uses a well-known URI pattern where each agent publishes an Agent Card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` describing its skills, authentication requirements, and endpoint. The OpenAgents model uses event-based discovery within a network (send `network.agent.discover` to `core`, get the roster back) and DID-based discovery across networks.

**4. Identity and verification.**
A2A delegates authentication to standard HTTP schemes (Bearer tokens, OAuth2, API keys) declared in the Agent Card. The OpenAgents model defines four progressive verification levels (anonymous → key-proof → JWT → DID) with the verification level tracked as part of each agent's network membership.

#### Interoperability

A2A is listed as a transport binding in the OpenAgents Network Model (see [Section 11: Transport Bindings](#11-transport-bindings)). This means:

- An OpenAgents agent can expose an A2A-compatible interface, publishing an Agent Card that describes its capabilities in A2A terms.
- An A2A client can interact with an OpenAgents agent without knowing it's backed by a network — it just sees a standard A2A endpoint.
- Conversely, an OpenAgents network can integrate with external A2A agents by treating A2A as a transport: events are translated to A2A messages/tasks at the boundary.

```
External A2A agent                     OpenAgents Network
┌──────────────┐                      ┌───────────────────────┐
│              │  A2A SendMessage      │                       │
│  A2A Client  │ ──────────────────→  │  A2A Transport Bridge │
│              │                      │  (translates to Event) │
│              │  ←──────────────────  │                       │
│              │  A2A Task/Artifact    │  ← events from network│
└──────────────┘                      └───────────────────────┘
```

The A2A transport binding maps:
- A2A `SendMessage` → OpenAgents event with appropriate type and target
- A2A `Task` states → OpenAgents events (`network.event.ack`, extension events)
- A2A `Artifact` → OpenAgents event payload or `resource/file/` entity
- A2A `AgentSkill` → OpenAgents `resource/tool/` registration

This makes A2A a peer protocol for external interop, while the OpenAgents Network Model governs the internal architecture of agent networks.
