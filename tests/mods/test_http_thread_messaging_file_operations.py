"""
HTTP Thread Messaging File Operations Test.

This test verifies that two real HTTP clients can:
1. Connect to the network using workspace_test.yaml with enforced HTTP transport
2. Upload files using the thread_messaging mod
3. Download files using the thread_messaging mod
4. Verify file content integrity

No mocks - uses real HTTP clients and network infrastructure.
