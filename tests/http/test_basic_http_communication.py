"""
Basic HTTP client communication test.

This test verifies that two real HTTP clients can:
1. Connect to the network using workspace_test.yaml with enforced HTTP transport
2. Send raw events to each other
3. Observe messages being received

No mocks - uses real HTTP clients and network infrastructure.
