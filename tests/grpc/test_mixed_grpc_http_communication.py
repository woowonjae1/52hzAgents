"""
Mixed gRPC-HTTP client communication test.

This test verifies that clients using different transport types can communicate:
1. One client connects using gRPC transport (enforced)
2. Another client connects using HTTP transport (enforced)
3. Both clients can send events to each other
4. Messages are properly routed between different transport types

No mocks - uses real gRPC and HTTP clients with network infrastructure.
