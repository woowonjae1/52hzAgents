"""
gRPC Workspace Client and WorkerAgent Integration Test.

This test verifies comprehensive communication between workspace clients and worker agents:
1. Workspace client sends channel message → WorkerAgent receives via on_channel_post
2. Workspace client sends direct message → WorkerAgent receives via on_direct
3. WorkerAgent replies to channel message → Workspace client can see the reply
4. Workspace client mentions WorkerAgent → WorkerAgent receives via on_channel_mention
5. Workspace client reacts to WorkerAgent message → WorkerAgent receives via on_reaction

Uses workspace_test.yaml for network configuration and real gRPC communication.

Note: This test demonstrates the intended functionality. The current implementation has
some issues with channel message delivery that need to be resolved in the core system.
